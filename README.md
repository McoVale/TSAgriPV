Data process from crop field orientation and Photovoltaic panels geometry to hourly ground irradiance and then agricultural yield.

Main notebooks are, currently, final_tab.ipynb, then excel.ipynb.

bugfix_final_tab.ipynb is the same than the previous one but with a much lighter computational time.

surface2 is an old notebook I used to do test and improve the code.

All others are yet to be implemented.

Please pardon my code if horrors are seen in this repo :')
