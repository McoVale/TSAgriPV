"""Get a matrix containing radiation values from each patch of a sky dome.

Creating this matrix is a necessary pre-step before doing incident radiation
analysis or generating a visualizations like a radiation rose.

This class uses Radiance's gendaymtx function to calculate the radiation
for each patch of the sky. Gendaymtx is written by Ian Ashdown and Greg Ward.
